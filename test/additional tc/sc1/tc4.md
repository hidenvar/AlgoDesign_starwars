in this test case we have 2 groups of base cities
group 1 :  bases 1 , 2, 3 
these bases have a safe target to fire at so they should choose the safe path to tg 1

group 2 : bases  4, 5, 6
these bases have no safe path so they have to pick one of revealed targets, they choose the lower defense


the distance between this 2 groups is > uncontrolled distance so they cannot reach other groups targets.


ans:
bases 1, 2, 3 fire via safe path to tg 1
bases  4, 5, 6 fire in fallback phase to tg4 with lower defense level
