city 1 and 2 can attack city 7 directly but not safe
city 5 joins the rapid fire by attacking city 7 using this path: 5 -> 1 -> 7

city 3 and 4 can attack city 8 directly but not safe similar to what is happening with city 1, 2 and 7

## version 1
* city 9 is safe for base 6 : fires using safe path
* city 8 has a lower defence level that city 9 so rapid fire on city 8 using city 3 and 4

## version 2
* city 9 is safe for base 6 : fires using safe path (similar to ver1)
* this time city 9 has a lower defence level so city 3 and 4 persorm a rapid fire on city 9 using base 6 as helper
