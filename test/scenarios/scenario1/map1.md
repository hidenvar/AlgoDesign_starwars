city1 is the base located in 0,0
we have 2 targets to destry

city 5 is a level 1 target meaing we can attack it form city 1 directly 
so the path 1 -> 5 is a valid path for this target

city 6 is a level 2 target for city1 meaning we cannot atack it directly and we need to reprogram
so the path 1 -> 2 -> 6  is a valid path for this target

the provided map is a very simple map for scenario1
city1 : our only base city
city3 , city4 : dummy normal cities
city2: helper city for target 6
