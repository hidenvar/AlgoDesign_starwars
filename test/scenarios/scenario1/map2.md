in this map we gave a base city that cannot attack any target cities
city1 : base city to attack city 3 in one level and city 4 in two levels
city2 : help city 1 attack city 4
city3 : level 1 target
city4 : level 2 target
city5 : useless base (cannot attack any target)


expected output: 
base 1 :
    1 -> 3
    1 -> 2 > 4
base 5 :
    no path found
